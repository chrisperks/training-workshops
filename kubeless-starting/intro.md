## Kubeless Starter 

Some quotes: 

> kubeless is a Kubernetes-native serverless framework that lets you deploy small bits of code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure plumbing.

https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless

>  If you are looking for an open source serverless solution that clones what you can find on AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, Kubeless is for you!

> You might want to use Kubeless if you need _AWS Lambda On Prem_ or you're not comfortable with the vendor lock-in which serverless functions bring.
